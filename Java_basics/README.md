# ðŸ“š Java (Basic + OOP + DSA)

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**! ðŸš€  
This repository contains all my code related to Java, covering **Basic Concepts**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## ðŸ”¹ About This Repository

This repo is a work-in-progress where Iâ€™m compiling everything I learn about Java.  
It currently includes:

- **Java Basics** â€” syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, etc.
- **OOP Concepts** â€” classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation.
- **DSA** â€” algorithms and data structures implemented in Java (ongoing).

I will be updating this repository **daily** with new concepts, explanations, and code examples.
